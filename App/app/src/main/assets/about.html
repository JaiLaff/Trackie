<h2>Trackie - Jai Lafferty</h2>
<p>Trackie is a weight tracking progress app designed to visually represent the weight of the user in their weight gain/loss journey.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this app is to create a non-trivial app for my Software Development for Mobile Devices unit at university.</p>
<p>The app had to implement a list of features using certain technologies available to us within the Android development ecosystem. Some of those requirements were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A minimum of 4-5 activities (fewer were acceptible given an application with greater complexity)
    </li>
    <li>
        Must make use of ActionBar/Toolbar, Fragments and demonstate a use of both global and contextual navigation in the design
    </li>
    <li>
        Must make use of local storage and networking.
    </li>
</ul>
