# Trackie - Jai Lafferty

## A small Android weight tracking app

Trackie is a weight tracking progress app designed to visually represent the weight of the user in their weight gain/loss journey.

### Objective

The objective of this app is to create a non-trivial app for my Software Development for Mobile Devices unit at university. The app had to implement a list of features using certain technologies available to us within the Android development ecosystem. Some of those requirements were:

- A minimum of 4-5 activities (fewer were acceptible given an application with greater complexity)
- Must make use of ActionBar/Toolbar, Fragments and demonstate a use of both global and contextual navigation in the design
- Must make use of local storage and networking.

### Features

- Save and load weight data in both Metric and Imperial
- Display this weight in a graph (Thanks to [PhilJay's MPAndroidChart Library](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart))
- Calculate BMI based on users' personal data
